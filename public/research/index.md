**Genomics of the Irish potato famine pathogen**
We're using high-throughput sequencing to explore the genomes of *Phytophthora infestans*, the causative agent of the Irish potato famine.
Its still here with us today and farmers employ large quatities of fungicide in hopes of avoiding it.
We hope to use evolutionary genomics to infer patterns of relatedness among clonal lineages that cause epidemics and sexually reproducing populations at the species center of diversity.
Throught the application of genomic tools we hope to one day prevent future epidemics of this pathogen.


**Computational biology**
In order to explore genome scale or 'big data' datasets, we need a lot of software.
We also need to create our own to help facilitate the exploration of topics that other bioinformaticians have yet to address.
I am lead developer and maintainer of [vcfR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vcfR), an R package to manipulate and visualize VCF data in R.
This has facilitated our work on genic copy number variation and population genetics of *P. infestans*.
If you enjoy R and have VCF data you'd like to analyse, give it a try!
