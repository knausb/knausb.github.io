      <title>CRAN memory error</title>

      <description>I have a package on CRAN where the CRAN tests are reporting a memory error. In order to use the address sanitizer (ASAN) we need to have a version of R that has been compiled specially to make use of it. In a previous post I described how we can use Docker to run rocker images so we do not have to change our system R. I’ve also validated the ASAN is working.</description>

      <description>The address sanitizer (ASAN) is a tool produced by google that detects memory coruption bugs. It is relevant to the work I do, in part, because CRAN checks contributed packages with this tool. This is a good practice on the part of CRAN to ensure that packages it hosts lack bugs. However, if you are unfamiliar with this tool it may present a formidable challenge to use. Here I explain how I’ve implemented it in my work.</description>
