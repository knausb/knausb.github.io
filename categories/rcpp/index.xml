      <description>A colleague recently asked about getting started using Rcpp. After I sent the e-mail I thought that information may be of use to others. So I decided to blog about it.
Rcpp is a package on CRAN that facilitates an interface between R and C++. It includes data structures that allow for easy sharing of data between the two languages. Because writting C++ code is usually more challenging than writing R code you should probably reserve it for tasks that you will repeat.</description>
