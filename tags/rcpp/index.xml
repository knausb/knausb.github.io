      <description>In C++ you can create functions in order to help organize your code. This is helpful as your project grows or if you have a task that is performed by a function that several other functions may call. However, the functions you create are only visible to the other funcitons that are contained in a single source file. As your project grows, you may want to distribute your functions among several files.</description>

      <title>CRAN memory error</title>

      <description>I have a package on CRAN where the CRAN tests are reporting a memory error. In order to use the address sanitizer (ASAN) we need to have a version of R that has been compiled specially to make use of it. In a previous post I described how we can use Docker to run rocker images so we do not have to change our system R. I’ve also validated the ASAN is working.</description>
