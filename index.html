	<h2>Brian J. Knaus</h2>
	<h4>Biologist, ecologist, geneticist, computational scientist</h4>
	
	<p>
	A biologist, these days, must wear many hats. 
	Author, naturalist, biochemist, molecular biologist, molecular geneticist, quantitative geneticist, computational biologist, statistician and graphic artist.
	We run the risk of becoming a jack of all trades but master of none.
	Some of us learn to choose our battles.
	Through this process we learn what issues are important, and we learn to master these.
	A biologist, these days, is a jack of many trades, as well as a master of several well chosen trades.
