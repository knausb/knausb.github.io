	<h2>Brian J. Knaus</h2>
	<h5>Quantitative and computational biologist, evolutionary genomics</h5>
	
	<p>
	A biologist, these days, must wear many hats. 
	Author, naturalist, molecular and quantitative geneticist, computational biologist, statistician and graphic artist.
	We run the risk of becoming a jack of all trades but master of none.
	Through this process we learn what issues are important, and we learn to master these.
	A biologist, these days, is a jack of many trades, as well as a master of several well chosen trades.
