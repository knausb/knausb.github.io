	<h2>Brian J. Knaus</h2>
	
	<p>
	A biologist, these days, must wear many hats. 
	Author, naturalist, biochemist, molecular biologist, molecular geneticist, quantitative geneticist, computational biologist, statistician and graphic artist.
	We run the risk of being jacks of all trades but masters of none.
